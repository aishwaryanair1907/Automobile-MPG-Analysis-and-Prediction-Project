# Automobile MPG Analysis and Prediction Project
# Overview
In this project, we explore the impact of various automobile engine factors on fuel efficiency (mpg) using the auto-mpg dataset. The dataset comprises information for 398 automobile models, including details such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name.

# Objectives
**Initial Analysis and Visualization:**
Explore and visualize the datasetand create visual plots and charts to describe relationships between engine factors and mpg.

**Linear Regression Analysis:**
Utilize the first 300 samples to run simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.
Investigate the relationship between mpg and relevant independent variables.
Report key regression metrics for each model:
    Multiple R-squared
    Adjusted R-squared
    Complete Linear Regression equation
    Maintain a log of these values for all models.
    
**Prediction and Evaluation:**
Use the best linear model(s) to predict mpg for the remaining 98 samples.
Compare predictions with the actual reported mpg.
Report and visualize residuals using:
    Residual Plot
    Histogram
# Technologies Used
R Programming Language

# Project Structure
data: Contains the auto-mpg dataset (auto-mpg.csv).
scripts: R scripts for data analysis, regression, prediction, and visualization

# Results and Contributions
This project contributes insights into the relationship between engine factors and fuel efficiency in automobiles. Regression analysis provides predictive models, and visualizations enhance the understanding of the dataset.
